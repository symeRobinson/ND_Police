## Credits
- [Overextended](https://github.com/overextended) for creating [ox_police](https://github.com/overextended/ox_police) which this was originally based on.
- [Testaross](https://github.com/Testaross) for beginning this project and contributing a lot to this and ox_police.
- [Hakko](https://github.com/hakkodevelopment) for converting sounds to native audio.
- Florek for resizing and modifying the props.

Everything from ox_police has been completely rewritten besides `client/evidence.lua`, `client/spikes.lua`, and `client/escort.lua` which have minimal changes from the original ox_police.

## Notes
- Evidence lockers and armories are handled by ox_inventory.
- If you're using NDCore you can create garages for police in `client/vehicle/data`.
- If you're using NDCore ND_MDT has a boss employee page.

If you have suggestions, post a new issue.
If you want to PR a feature, you should ask first (so you won't waste time).
